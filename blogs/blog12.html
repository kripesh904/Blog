            <p>The world of Ai is new and shiny, with everyone running around the technology like the prized possession it is. Everyone wants to win this AI race, every superpower country from the USA to China. But why and since when did AI become this important in the race of power in the dominance of the globe. When did AI start becoming the thing countries went to war for. Let us understand it from where it all started. </p>
<p>The fundamental concept of AI came from a rather simple question, “Can machines think?” The answer to which is pretty clear in today's day and age, but then, not so much. In the 1950s, the development of earlier AI programs was already in the works, from programs like logic theorists that were designed to solve mathematical theorems mimicking human intelligence to the general problem solver which was designed to solve puzzles, plan tasks, etc. In the early 2000s, Machine learning and statistical models gained momentum, which allowed computers to learn patterns from data and train, improving over time. SVMs became popular as a technique for classification and regression tasks making it revolutionary for statistics and data handling. </p>
<p>It all doesn’t sound like much but back in the decade, it was a huge deal as computers were fundamentally treated as a calculator and not a smart machine who could beat what humans could do. And the slow developments in the world of Ai changed everything, maybe not immediately but a change and a shift was beginning.</p>

<p>In the mid 2000s we all witnessed the big boom of the internet, which created unimaginable opportunities in the field of AI. Machine learning models could now be trained on massive datasets collected from the internet boom, leading to more accurate predictions, better pattern recognition, and more trustworthy models.Object recognition and face detection systems made significant progress. And as the decade ended, it marked the beginning of deep learning. </p>

<p>Deep learning, while a complex concept at its core, is machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, to mimic the complex decision-making power of the human brain. A neural network is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains. Imagine you’ve shifted to a new home just now, and the location goes through connected complex roads. Now when you go there for the first time, you need proper data of where to go, when you go there for the second time, you might need help again, but repeated cycles will train your mind to know where your house is. Just like this, millions of data is given to the network and then the layers finds patterns connections link ups between the data, while giving example of text-based AIs, even how the words are structured and repeated and this pattern is replicated in output and after every mistake the ai becomes more strong because it learns again from the output data.</p>

<p>This success of deep learning began to attract significant attention. Researchers achieved major breakthroughs in speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). As the attention grew, the potential of Ai was growing steadily, in varied sectors like healthcare, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and many more. This growing attention led tech companies’ interests leading to Google acquiring deepmind in 2014; solidifying the importance of AI in the new age of technology. </p>

<p>In 2015, China launched its "Made in China 2025" initiative, which included AI as a key strategic technology. This investment made it pretty evident of China's ambitions to become a global leader in the field of AI. The trade war between the U.S. and China, starting around 2018, was not just about tariffs and trade imbalances, it was also about technology and AI, as china challenged America’s soft powers with its technology, the USA sought to limit China’s access to AI technologies through restrictions on companies like Huawei, while China continued to build its own domestic capabilities.
Just like space became one of the major points of the cold wars between the USA and USSR, technology is slowly becoming the focal point of the USA China rivalry.</p>

<p>This rivalry was fueled more so when DeepSeek by china released in minimum costs and maximum results directly competing with the USA’s ChatGPT. This direct head on fight has fueled down the American Stock Market and again proved vital to the soft powers of the globe. All in all, this is the age of AI technology, whoever wins this race will hold the maximum power in the coming decades and centuries because this is not the war fought by armies and soldiers, it is fought by mind and computing, as whoever wins this war dictates how the world functions, just like the US did after the cold war.</p>
