            <p>I am alone.<br>
                In a dark cold room with no one,<br>
                but this silence,<br>
                and this darkness,<br>
                And my odd thoughts.<br>
                I distract myself in those worldly distractions to avoid but then<br>
                those thoughts screams in my conscience</p>

            <p><strong>What if you're dying tomorrow</strong></p>

            <p>When I'll be counting my last heartbeats<br>
                And I'll be closer to that last than any beat before<br>
                When the afterlife starts to somehow begin<br>
                And I'm awaiting those 7 minute<br>
                to reminisce my breath for the last second</p>

            <p>I ponder what my mind will be thinking then<br>
                Or will it even have the prowess to think or my mind will all be in vain.<br>
                With no sight sound smell or sane<br>
                And a dark ending in the jail<br>
                Of my worldly frustrations and messed up conscience</p>

            <p>Then<br>
                How will I meet my eye to my sister<br>
                and tell her she raised me well<br>
                When maybe I've lived like a disgrace to their name</p>

            <p>How will I say to my mom<br>
                that I tried mom,<br>
                I tried<br>
                When her hands will not be patting my head.</p>

            <p>How will I ask my father<br>
                if I was a good son<br>
                Or not<br>
                When I would have known by then the answer was a no.</p>

            <p>But what it even matters at the end<br>
                The number of heartbeats I lived.<br>
                number of people at my funeral.<br>
                number of properties inherited.<br>
                <strong>Or. Simply. Just. My. Deathbed.</strong></p>

            <p>Deathbed feels like a verdict<br>
                prepared with your hurt heart.<br>
                Judging yourself<br>
                like piercing your own heart with a glass shard<br>
                With your own will and your own hand.<br>
                And every part of your heart is now leaking, a sharp red.<br>
                The irony I can finally breathe</p>

            <p>Now<br>
                I don't have to prove anyone<br>
                that im strong and I'm someone<br>
                That I'm good enough. That I won<br>
                I can accept that I lost Cus<br>
                Next morning I won't regret that I lived unlike my dreams dreamt<br>
                Next morning I won't regret I let myself flow to the world end<br>
                Next morning I won't regret living less and less like myself<br>
                Next morning I won't regret confessing my thoughts<br>
                Next morning I won't regret losing someone<br>
                Next morning I won't regret hurting you<br>
                Cause there is no tomorrow, there is next morning.<br>
                <strong>I'm dying tomorrow.</strong></p>
