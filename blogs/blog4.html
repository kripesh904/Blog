            <p>Nepal is a country of vivid and distinct culture and traditions, but sadly, discrimination lies within
                the culture of Nepalese society. Discrimination is not a new-age concept for human society, but
                societies have been adopting the concept of inclusiveness. Regardless, such problems still exist on
                different levels. In Nepal, caste discrimination hasn’t come to a halt due to stereotyping of castes,
                untouchability, racist/casteist slurs, and discriminated opportunities. Thus, Nepal, a beautiful
                country, has been covered by the shadows of discrimination.</p>
            <p>The major issue with Nepalese rural as well as some urban societies is untouchability. The so-called
                lower-caste people are suppressed and subjected to disgust, so much so that their mere touch disgraces
                the frail superiority of the so-called upper castes. This is a problem so common in the rural setup in
                Nepal, but the only solutions yet explored are quotas and reservations.</p>
            <p>Another major issue lies in the form of racial/casteist stereotyping. This rarely comes up as a major
                issue, but it infuses discrimination in the blood of an average working man. This is an example of how
                minor-looking comments, in the façade of a joke or laughter, helps prove and perpetuates the
                long-lasting problems of the state.</p>
            <p>Similarly, another issue is that of racial/casteist slurs. A comment meant to degrade and ridicule
                another race or caste. Such slurs hamper the confidence and aspirations of a person from a similar
                environment and lifestyle, just another race. This contributes to the overall problem of racial
                discrimination and only cements its foundation for such social evils.</p>
            <p>Finally, another major issue is that of varied opportunities, discrimination that we see in real life.
                Whether it is getting a home to rent or job opportunities in small to big corporations, if you ask any
                so-called discriminated races, their search for a home to rent is just a long-living, never-ending case
                of discrimination. Such cases have been highlighted in the media but have led to no solution.</p>
            <p>To sum it up, racial and caste discrimination has thrived in Nepalese society as long as the society itself. It may be as minor-seeming as stereotyping or as major as untouchability. The Nepalese society still has a major mark to remove for societal development and maturity. Even though I personally haven't faced it, a problem does exist, and it should be solved right now and the solution starts from us; not the government, not any organizations; the change will begin only from us, within us.</p>
