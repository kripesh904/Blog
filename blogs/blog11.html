            <p>She wore the cloak</p>
            <p>Early in the morning</p>
            <p>For a 36 hour shift</p>
            <p>Hectic, but her dream</p>
            <p>To save those in need</p>
            <p>She had cracked neet</p>
            <p>had done her pg</p>
            <p>Now her life was</p>
            <p>What her 8 year old dreamed</p>
            <p>The white cloak</p>
            <p>The white cloak</p>
            <p>The white cloak</p>
            <p>Is now stained</p>
            <p>It is stained with the cruelty</p>
            <p>Of ones who never</p>
            <p>Understood what it's to be a human</p>
            <p>The white cloak</p>
            <p>Is now unsafe</p>
            <p>The white cloak</p>
            <p>Is now wretched</p>
            <p>Cus they were numerous and she was one</p>
            <p>Cus they were monsters and she was a mere human</p>
            <p>How could she put a fight against</p>
            <p>The monsters</p>
            <p>Cruel monsters</p>
            <p>Bastards</p>
            <p>They are who stain the white cloak</p>
            <p>They are who wear a black hoax</p>
            <p>Of power and male superiority,</p>
            <p>A hoax of them being invincible</p>
            <p>Or maybe its true</p>
            <p>When will they be captured?</p>
            <p>After a decade has passed?</p>
            <p>Or after 8 years?</p>
            <p>How many more nirbhayas</p>
            <p>How many more doctors</p>
            <p>How many more workers</p>
            <p>How many more girls</p>
            <p>How many more children</p>
            <p>And how many more woman</p>
            <p>How many more hathras</p>
            <p>How many more kolkata</p>
            <p>How many more kanchanpur</p>
            <p>How many more kathmandu</p>
            <p>The world is wretched</p>
            <p>And unsafe</p>
            <p>But who is responsible</p>
            <p>Politicianâ€™s son</p>
            <p>Or those high in power</p>
            <p>Everyone</p>
            <p>Or No one</p>
            <p>Everyone</p>
            <p>Everyone</p>
            <p>Everyone</p>
