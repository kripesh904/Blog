                “Maitighar Mandala is a masterful work of art by the artisans and craftsmen to create an emblem that
                represents the holistic identity of the country, the art of the country, a way to showcase our roots and
                culture in a finessed masterpiece. A piece that represented Nepal as a country of art and architecture.”
                This is what I thought I was, I thought that I was a masterpiece, a statement of a work of art, that
                will be remembered and visited for the artistry and the mesmerizing beauty. I had thought that I would
                be remembered among the masses as a wonderful piece of art, a place where the national flag waves and
                glides proudly. But, it seems like now that I was wrong. Soon, my delusion was going to implode and how.
                The streets that represented masterful art were about to be a chaotic mess, a political mishap, perhaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon enough, the beautiful Mandala, I, witnessed the struggles in life of a Nepali, through their voice
                in protests. I soon began to witness a crowd of people at my roadside, every passing day. People of
                different regions and religions, of different creeds and castes, of various ideologies and intentions.
                The people– shouting, screaming, crying, begging and barely surviving. I soon knew what helplessness
                looked like.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a crowd of thousands, the sun, shining brighter than the day, the heat, burning the skin on your
                body, you're thirsty, and hungry, standing in the sun for hours, and then you feel that you're being
                pushed, by the left, right, front and back. Your body moves as the crowd wants, your consciousness is
                lost somewhere. You hear the sound of the people’s screams, you can guess that someone is being beaten.
                You can feel the tear gas, now, your eyes don't see. All you can hear is a high frequency chaos, someone
                screaming and crying, someone begging and someone dying. And now you can't even breathe, every gasp of
                air is a blessing, every heartbeat a miracle. Then, you stop hearing, the air you're gasping for is also
                lost somewhere and the heartbeat too, and now all you can do is nothing, just remain and feel the
                helplessness through every nerve of your body, hoping that people don't crush you by their feet. I saw,
                then, what helplessness is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every passing day, people would crowd the road, barely survive, some died, and still show up the next
                day. I heard their voices, their pain and struggles, saw their banners and their words, of protest. I
                also heard their screams and screeches, and saw the blood, rolling down in beads, after being crushed by
                the crowd. I saw suffocation, gasping for air. I saw fear of death, in those rebelling eyes, and then I
                saw death, just death. At first, I was confused, I used to question the chaos of what was going on and
                why, questions, with no answers. I used to doubt why it had to happen. Why would a normal human, get out
                of the house, get out of the comfort of those four walls. And get to the road. It was beyond me why
                someone would even remotely think to do, out of his comfort to get to the streets, just to spend a
                horrid day in the scorching heat. I was naive and I used to question it everyday, because everyday there
                was someone, ready with their voice and banners. I didn’t understand if they didn’t have a job to run
                to, a family to see through, and a life to get back to. Maybe they didn’t. But these questions of whys
                never left me.
            </p>
            <p>
                By every passing day, few more people gathered in my mundane state, with the same words of protests,
                same banners, same words, same voices. Everyday, the protests exhausted me a little more, my beauty died
                within a little more, and the days became a little more tougher. This questioning of the whys drained me
                out, and finally after witnessing the mundane and anxious days, I think I got an answer to my whys.
            </p>

                ”System.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I, the so-called beautiful Mandala, finally realized that the real culprit behind all of this was the
                system that has made every citizen of this country a hopeless being. At least, those whose family
                doesn’t belong inside the periphery. Being a part of this country is like balancing on a thin bamboo
                stick above a lava pool, one wrong step and you’re forgotten. I realized that these people come to me to
                protest, because yes they don't have a job to go to, because no, they do have a family to see through,
                and no they do have a life to get back to, and they’re asking for their normality back, their lives
                back. Because something or the other has ruined it, the scams, the scandals, the corruption or the weak
                system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyday as the mandala, I realize that the world is unfair, and the rich and the powerful take it all,
                in a tick of a clock. with their greed and lust for money, power or both. Everyday, I realize that these
                power hungry ‘leaders’ so easily face themselves in the mirror knowing that someone is suffering due to
                them and their power lusty maneuvers, whether be it natural calamities: houses and lives flooding by the
                floods, landslides, earthquakes; the cooperatives scandals: hundreds of crores of money embezzled and
                the victims, normals working class and their hard earned money; corruption scandals: lands, properties,
                and even forged documents, abuse of power; the rape cases, whose count has been forgotten and hidden in
                the files behind the fake numbers somewhere. And many more, without a strike of guilt on their faces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each passing day, standing tall, bearing and waving the national flag, I feel spurned, bearing the flag
                that goes abroad in the shoulders and returns back in coffins. I am heartbroken to know that the first
                time someone bears this flag is when they’re fleeing the country, not in sports, education, science,
                technology, innovations, literature, art, creativity, entertainment or any fields and achievements. Not
                because this country doesn’t produce a capable populus, but because the system wretches the soul of
                every capable person, that someone capable would also curse the system twice before leaving the country,
                because they know what they could be, and what they are. Their innovation, creativity, their thinking,
                self esteem, their knowledge, their strengths, their capabilities are all down to drain, all credits to
                the corrupt and age-old system and now, they bid the country a good riddance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, now I know why my roadsides are chock-full of people, why my pavements are a roofless home for
                some, why some people are willing to die, why they leave their homes with their voice and banners to
                show up again. Because they have nothing to go to. Some of them lost all of their life savings, some of
                them got loaned unfairly, some of them had their family destroyed and some of their lives have been
                flooded, and some of them have seen from close up what it is like, and some of them are those who want
                to live in a better country, so they try to make their country better. It is not like I am unaware that
                my roadsides are also used for political extremism, and manipulation. I am not unaware that there are
                victims of manipulation who are a part of the crowd, but then I see the pain behind those genuine
                voices, those genuine banners, and those genuine protests, and bask in my gloom.
            </p>
            <p>
                My beauty has withered, and my name too, now, no one is here to appreciate the art of mine, but rather I
                am known for the protests, withered. And the part I’m most disappointed about is they disregard the
                protests without even wanting to know the reasons and the intentions. They forget to realize that if
                people are leaving their home, then maybe they have a reason, their helplessness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even after answering all my questions, I am still afraid of that one word. The day that started with a
                hope that something might change, if not the country, their life just might, after a long day, when
                there seems to be no results, when after their continuous begging, no one even tries to listen, forget
                empathize, neither the politicians in their cabinets, nor the general people walking by, when the sun
                sets, and the darkness arises, something seeps in their eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hopelessness.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And now I have stopped hoping as well, hopeless. I saw the eyes of people, glitter in hope, and soon
                dull down far too many times that I am afraid to hope that something will change, that anything will
                change. I am scared that soon, they will also see those dull eyes, and forget that one ounce of hope
                they started with. I am afraid they will also make do with the makeshift system, and just stop trying.
                Then, we would have failed, as a country, as a nation.
