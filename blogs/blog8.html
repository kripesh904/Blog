            <p>After a long and tiring day at work,<br>
            A lady walks down the road of street 14.<br>
            Hating every step of the walk in her high heels,<br>
            Listening to her favorite Taylor Swift,<br>
            Carrying her favourite blue bag.<br>
            Her house in street 17 seems like a prolonged dream,<br>
            Never seeing the day of light.</p>
            
            <p>The light of the sun has sunk and now,<br>
            The day has darkened itself.<br>
            She is still violently cursing her heels,<br>
            And the sun, for setting this early.<br>
            When she reaches street 15,<br>
            Gasping on the achievement,<br>
            She stops to fix her heel and<br>
            Takes the airpods off her ear,<br>
            Finally able to hear.</p>
            
            <p>Right then,<br>
            A man enters the scene.<br>
            A man.<br>
            The words spoken by him when<br>
            She was still fixing the heel made her wish<br>
            The airpods were still in her ears.<br>
            She fearing of the man's intentions,<br>
            carrying the heels in one hand,<br>
            and the bag and pods in another,<br>
            briskly walked.<br>
            When he started following her steps,<br>
            she hurriedly runs.<br>
            Runs from the silent alley of the street.<br>
            But, the man was faster.<br>
            He chased her down.<br>
            Pushed her in the wall with his hands,<br>
            The red heels banged the ground,<br>
            The bag struck the dirt.<br>
            Airpods broke.</p>
            
            <p>He, grippingly catched her by her waist,<br>
            pinning her to the wall.<br>
            The girl was still fighting and screaming<br>
            for her life.<br>
            But he made her his only quest,<br>
            Now, all heard was cries and screams,<br>
            The drunk bastard with his lustful schemes,<br>
            He, starts to scratch her chest,<br>
            The woman, still numb, the man starts to undress.<br>
            The teenager trying to lose the grip,<br>
            bites his forearm, on the vein,<br>
            slowly the grip losens and she finally<br>
            throws the man away.<br>
            She runs and runs and runs,<br>
            and runs and runs and runs,<br>
            as if it was the last run of her life.</p>
            
            <p>She reached street 17,<br>
            faster than the whole journey.<br>
            She rushingly approaches her mother,<br>
            with dirt on the tore clothes,<br>
            naked feet,<br>
            and eyes full of tears.<br>
            She tried to utter words,<br>
            but the words only meant to self-loathe.<br>
            Her mother asks and asks but<br>
            She didn't utter a single moan,<br>
            Why? Because she was all alone.<br>
            Her mother was undoubtedly with her but<br>
            she also would have asked her to forget it<br>
            For in our society,<br>
            Itâ€™s better to live with scars all life with secrets engraved,<br>
            Rather than living enslaved, with remarks and stamps.</p>
            
            <p>The reasons why the words are left unsaid and unfinished,<br>
            The words which made her inner self rot her esteem,<br>
            The words which filled her whole body with disgust.<br>
            Swallowing every bit of tear and hurt,<br>
            She continued to live her life.<br>
            But, she never wore heels ever again.<br>
            Never bought anything blue,<br>
            Never listened to Taylor Swift,<br>
            Never approached the 15th street,<br>
            Never raised her head,<br>
            Never faced herself in a mirror,<br>
            Never truly lived.<br>
            Because something <strong>died</strong> that night.</p>
