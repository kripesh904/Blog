            </a>
            <p>Studio Ghibli has long been a symbol of creativity and originality, captivating audiences with its
                hand-drawn animation. However, a new wave of Ghibli-inspired art has begun to take shape, blending
                traditional animation techniques with digital tools and modern design trends. This shift has sparked a
                debate: is this new art trend an evolution of Ghibli's legacy, or does it compromise the originality
                that made Ghibli films so beloved?  <a href="blogs/blog1.html">Read More</a></p>

            </a>
            <p>After the recent news of the death of child singing prodigy Sachin Pariyar sparked outrage on the
                internet, many netizens started the blame game. While the blame on the father for his ordeal, and
                the so called YouTube Media are not entirely wrong, there seems to be a lack of introspection. We,
                as a society, have failed in this instance. Why? <a href="blogs/blog2.html">Read More</a></p>

            </a>
            <p>Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses and individuals store and access data. It allows users
                to store and access their files, applications, and services over the internet rather than relying on
                traditional on-premises hardware. With its rapid growth and adoption, cloud computing has become a

                <h1>The Rise of Edge Computing</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to the source of data generation, rather
                than relying on centralized cloud servers. This process minimizes the latency typically involved when
                sending data to the cloud, allowing for real-time analysis and quicker decision-making. In edge
                computing, devices like sensors, routers, or gateways, which sit at the "edge" of the network, handle
                much of the data processing. <a href="blogs/blog7.html">Read More</a></p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized multiple fields in recent years, with one of the most

                patterns, correlations, trends, or anomalies. It’s like being a digital archaeologist, sifting through
