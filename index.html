            <p>In front of Nepal's Parliament with the newly elected Prime Minister, a man took to the streets;
                drenched himself in diesel and set himself on fire on January 23, 2023. He believed it to be a
                statement against those who sat inside those rooms of the parliament, disregarding the daily truth
                and hardships of Nepalese citizens like pass and play. </p>

                    <h1>Viral kids on internet: A wake-up call for society</h1>
                </a>
                <p>After the recent news of the death of child singing prodigy Sachin Pariyar sparked outrage on the
                    internet, many netizens started the blame game. While the blame on the father for his ordeal, and
                    the so called YouTube Media are not entirely wrong, there seems to be a lack of introspection. We,
                    as a society, have failed in this instance. Why? <a href="blogs/blog2.html">Read More</a></p>

                </a>
                <p>I had thought that I would be remembered among the masses as a wonderful piece of art, a place where
                    the national flag waves and glides proudly. But, it seems like now that I was wrong. Soon, my
                    delusion was going to implode and how. The streets that represented masterful art were about to be a
                    chaotic mess, a political mishap, perhaps. <a href="blogs/blog3.html">Read More</a></p>

                    <h1>Nepal, Hidden by the Shadows of Discrimination</h1>
                </a>
                <p>Discrimination is not a new-age concept for human society, but societies have been adopting the
                    concept of inclusiveness. Regardless, such problems still exist on different levels. In Nepal, caste
                    discrimination hasnâ€™t come to a halt due to stereotyping of castes, untouchability, racist/casteist
                    slurs, and discriminated opportunities. Nepal, a beautiful country, has been covered by the shadows
                    of discrimination. <a href="blogs/blog4.html">Read More</a></p>
