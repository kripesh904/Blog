            </a>
            <p>Studio Ghibli has long been a symbol of creativity and originality, captivating audiences with its
                hand-drawn animation. However, a new wave of Ghibli-inspired art has begun to take shape, blending
                traditional animation techniques with digital tools and modern design trends. This shift has sparked a
                debate: is this new art trend an evolution of Ghibli's legacy, or does it compromise the originality
                that made Ghibli films so beloved? </p>

            </a>
            <p>After the recent news of the death of child singing prodigy Sachin Pariyar sparked outrage on the
                internet, many netizens started the blame game. While the blame on the father for his ordeal, and
                the so called YouTube Media are not entirely wrong, there seems to be a lack of introspection. We,
                as a society, have failed in this instance. Why? <a href="blogs/blog2.html">Read More</a></p>
