                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Only power that can contain and capture the whole world is a pen. Writing is the only thing that can capture the unthinkable, the unspeakable, the unhearable in words that you can see, hear and read. The sky also is not the limit. You keep where the limit is. I always found writing my words and thoughts liberating like a caged bird given the whole sky to fly all around to glide with its wings. Writing is freedom, to express every bit and gist of your emotions through words, carefree. Writing for me is nostalgia and uncertainty. To get lost in something as beautiful as the nostalgic past or as uncertain as the endless future. That is why I, Kripesh Raj Sharma, took up the pen one day and decided to write endlessly without caring a bit about what is, what was or what will be. Writing is beyond time and boundaries. To imagine and to create.</p>
